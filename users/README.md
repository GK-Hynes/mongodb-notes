# Demo Users database

A simple app, which connects users to blogposts and comments, built for Stephen Grider's [Complete Developer's Guide to MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/) course to practice CRUD operations with MongoDB.

The app uses [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to structure the MongoDB collections and make operations easier.

The testing library is [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).
