# Muber

A Node and Express server connecting to a MongoDB database, providing the API for an Uber-like app.

The app was built for Stephen Grider's [Complete Developer's Guide to MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/) course to practice integrating MongoDB into a Node app and working with geospatial data in MongoDB.

The (hypothetical) frontend can query the API for drivers based off their location.

Testing is carried out using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).
